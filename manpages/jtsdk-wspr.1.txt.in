functions are currently enabled:

*--clean::
*Currently-Disabled*: This function will attempt to clean up, +remove+, older
builds, leaving only the last build compiled for a given application. It is
still in beta testing.

[FILEBUG]
*--file-bug
*Currently-Disabled*: This function is used is similar to +++--sysinfo+++,
in that, it will use the same code to gather information, then combine them in
an easy to use .tar.gz file for sending vial email.

*--help::
*Currently-Disabled*: Displays the main help page, and information HTML and
manpage documents.

*--supported::
*Currently-Disabled*: List what WSJT applications are currently supported.

== BUGS
If you find a bug or suspect *JTSDK* is not acting as you think it should,
send an email with as much detail as possible to:
<wsjt-devel@lists.sourceforge.net>

It may also be helpful to use the +++file-bug+++ options to gather more system
system information beforehand.
