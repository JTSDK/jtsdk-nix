programmers to make the program better. Bugs may be reported to WSJT Group 
(email address wsjtgroup@yahoogroups.com) or the WSJT Developers list 
(wsjt-devel@lists.sourceforge.net). To be useful, bug reports should include
at least the following information:

* Program version
* Operating system
* Concise description of the problem
* Sequence of steps required to reproduce the problem

Feature Requests

Suggestions from users often result in new program features. Good ideas are
always welcome: if thereâ€™s a feature you would like to see in WSJT-X, spell
it out in as much detail as seems useful and send it to us at one the the email
addresses given a few lines above. Be sure to explain why you think the feature
is desirable, and what sort of other users might find it so.
