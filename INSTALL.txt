Amateur Radio Operators.

./autogen.sh --with-distro=ubuntu --enable-parallel=yes

For Debian, Type:

* Then Type: make

* If there were no errors after make, re-run the autogen.sh command
  us used above. In this example, we're using Ubuntu:

  ./autogen.sh --with-distro=ubuntu --enable-parallel=yes
  
* Type: sudo make install

If there were no errors, the installation is finished.


TO RUN JTSDK:

In a terminal ( Ctrl+Alt+T )
* Type: jtsdk


APPLICATION BUILD NOTES

* If building WSJT-X, build Hamlib3 first, then build WSJT-X
* WSPR and WSJT do not require Hamlib3
* To update your builds, simply run JTSDK, and select the package
* Ensure you update Hamlib3 often, as updates are frequently posted.


POTENTIAL ISSUES

* Due to package incompatibilities with Debian Jessie (8.0), WSJT
  and WSPR will compile, but may give you runtime errors. Solutions
  to this are being worked on, but at the present time, we do not
  have a valid fix. Tis problem is a packaging issue, not an WSPR or
  WSJT bug.

* The Mint 17.1 Cinnamon Desktop install python-numpy as part of it's
  desktop environment. If you encounter PObject errors when running
  WSPR or WSJT, more than likely this is the cause. WSPR and WSJT requires
  python3-numpy. TO resolve, remove python-numpy, but be warned, this may
  cause unexpected behavior in your Desktop Environment.
