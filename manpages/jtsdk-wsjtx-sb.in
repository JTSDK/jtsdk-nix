== NAME
jtsdk-wsjtx-sb - WSJT-X Superbuild Script


== SYNOPSIS
jtsdk-wsjtx-sb


== DESCRIPTION
*WSJT-X Superbuild* builds the WSJT-X application. It  does not  directly
contain the source files, instead it consists of a CMake script that
builds the application  by fetching the sources from their respective
source control repositories and then building the application.

WSJT-X also has a CMake build system  but currently it also has a
dependency on a library called Hamlib which itself has to built from a
fork of the official Hamlib project. The Hamlib fork is used because
it contains the latest patches not yet accepted by the Hamlib
development team.

This script combines the building of Hamlib and WSJT-X. I also has a
two phase mode that builds a complete source package in phase one that
can then be transferred to another build host to be built in phase two
there. This two  phase mode is aimed at Linux package maintainers who
have to have a complete upstream source package that can be built on a
restricted build server.


== OPTIONS
This script should be run from within JTSDK. No options are available.


== BUGS
If you find a bug or suspect *JTSDK WSJTX* is not acting as you think it should,
send an email with as much detail as possible to:
<wsjt-devel@lists.sourceforge.net>

It may also be helpful to use the +++file-bug+++ options to gather more system
system information beforehand.
