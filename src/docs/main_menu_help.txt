INTRODUCTION

 JTSDK allows you to build most of the WSJT applications through
 an easy to use menu system. Several build options exist for each
 application.

 Except for the WSJT-X Super-Build, all WSJT-X builds require Hamlib3
 to be built before running then application build. If it is not
 found in the default location, a message will be displayed prompting you
 to perform the build first.

 If the user has the knowledge, there is nothing stopping them from building
 the packages from the command line after JTSDK installation. In fact,
 many developers prefer this method as it allows for much greater control over
 the various aspects of the build.


BUILD DESCRIPTIONS

 WSJT-X 1.5 (devel) and WSJT-X 1.4 (Release)
 
 There are (3) primary build types:
 * Release ..: Install Release
 * Debug ....: Install Release With Debugging Enabled
 * Package ..: Distribution Package
 
 WSJT-X v1.5 is currently the head of the development. It is
 updated often and the current plan it to start producing RC's (Release
 Candidates) from this branch in preparation to formally release v1.5.

 Early in April-2015, WSJT-X v1.4 was formally released and placed in
 a dormant state with respect to development. Unless there is a specific
 issue that cannot be resolved in the v1.5 branch, you should not expect
 much activity in the branch.

 The distribution ( package ) is only available for select Linux and Mac
 distributions. At the time of this writing, the package target supports:
 
 Debian Based ..: Debian, Ubuntu, Mint etc.
 RPM Based .....: Fedora, OpenSUSE etc


 WSJT-X 1.6 (exp)

 This is an experimental branch for testing new concepts, ideas and code.
 It is subject to frequent updates, all of which may not land in a final
 release version.
 
 There are (2) primary build types:
 * Release ..: Install Release
 * Debug ....: Install Release With Debugging Enabled


 WSJT v10 and WSPR v4.0
 
 Both WSJT and WSPR have many targets. Currently, the build script
 simply builds the install target. Later versions JTSDK will include
 individual targets for each application. 
 
 
 WSPR-X and MAP65

 WSPR-X and MAP65 cannot be built on Linux without applying several
 patches. As such, the builds are classed as "under development" at
 this time. When the source codes has been updated to build on Linux,
 the builds will be enabled.

 Hamlib3

 Hamlib3 is a custom Git repository maintained by Bill (G4WJS). Updates to
 this repo may eventually land in the Official Hamlib libraries, however,
 when the updates will be included is unknown. 

 There is only one target type for building Hamlib3. Selecting the build from
 the menu is all that is required. You should re-build Hamlib3 often, in
 particular, before building any of the WSJT-X versions.
