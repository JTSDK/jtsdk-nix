BUILD INFORMATION
 The following builds are available for WSJT-X:

* Release ...... Install Release Target
* Debug ........ Install Debug Target


INSTALL LOCATIONS
 All of the builds, including the package installer, are located
 in sub-folders under wsjtx. If you did not change the default
 home directory during configure, the following applies:
 
 Source ...: /home/$USER/jtsdk/src/wsjtx_exp
 Release ..: /home/$USER/jtsdk/wsjtx/1.6.0/install/Release
 Debug ....: /home/$USER/jtsdk/wsjtx/1.6.0/install/Debug

 If you used --enable-separate during the configure process, each of the
 base folders will be appended with the SVN revision number. This allow for
 separating the each revision into it's owb build and install tree. For
 example:
 
 WSJT-X Version ...: 1.6.0
 SVN Change Rev ...: r5295
 
 The above would result in the following paths:

 Release ..: /home/$USER/jtsdk/wsjtx/1.6.0/1.6.0-r5295/install/Release
 Debug ....: /home/$USER/jtsdk/wsjtx/1.6.0/1.6.0-r5295/install/Debug
