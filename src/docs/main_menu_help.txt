page-down, arrow UP/DWN and HOME/END keys available on most keyboards.
If the lines are too long to be displayed in the box, the LEFT/RIGHT keys

INTRODUCTION

 JTSDK allows you to build most of the WSJT applications through
 an easy to use menu system. Several build options exist for each
 application.

 Except for the WSJT-X Super-Build, all WSJT-X builds require Hamlib3
 to be built before running then application build. If it is not
 found in the default location, a message will be displayed prompting you
 to perform the build first.

 If the user has the knowledge, there is nothing stopping them from building
 the packages from the command line after JTSDK installation. In fact,
 many developers prefer this method as it allows for much greater control over
 the various aspects of the build.


BUILD DESCRIPTIONS

 WSJT-X 1.6.1
 
 This is an experimental branch to testing new features and functions.
 The current focus is porting several modes from WSJT (JT4, JT65B, JT65C)
 and testing the potential for WSPR inclusion.
 
 Available build targets: ( Release, Debug and Package )
 
 
 WSJT-X 1.6.0
 
 This branch is the head of development for WSJT-X. It is host to any
 and all kinds of improvements.
 
 Available build targets: ( Release, Debug and Package )
 
 
 WSJT-X 1.5 RC
 
 This branch is the release candidate branch. On any give day is can be
 incremented upwards to produce the next public testing version.
 
 Available build targets: ( Release, Debug and Package )
 
 
 WSJTX 1.4 (Released)
 
 JTSDK no longer builds this version, as it has been formally relseased by
 the project team.
 
 
 WSJT v10 and WSPR v4.0
 
 Both WSJT and WSPR have many targets. Currently, the build script
 simply builds the install target. Later versions JTSDK will include
 individual targets for each application. 
 
 
 WSPR-X and MAP65

 WSPR-X and MAP65 cannot be built on Linux without applying several
 patches. As such, the builds are classed as "under development" at
 this time. When the source codes has been updated to build on Linux,
 the builds will be enabled.

 Hamlib3

 Hamlib3 is a custom Git repository maintained by Bill (G4WJS). Updates to
 this repo may eventually land in the Official Hamlib libraries, however,
 when the updates will be included is unknown. 

 There is only one target type for building Hamlib3. Selecting the build from
 the menu is all that is required. You should re-build Hamlib3 often, in
 particular, before building any of the WSJT-X versions.
