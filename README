JTSDK is a collection of Bash scripts designed to assist
users in compiling the various WSJT applications used by
Amateur Radio Operators.

* Download jtsdk-nix-2.0.7.tar.gz
* Extract: tar -xf jtsdk-nix-2.0.7.tar.gz
* cd ./jtsdk-nix-2.0.7
* ./autogeh.sh
* make
* sudo make install

TO RUN JTSDK:
* In a terminal..: jtsdk

TO UNINSTALL
* cd ./jtsdk-nix-2.0.4
* sudo make uninstall

APPLICATION BUILD NOTES
* If building WSJT-X, build Hamlib3 first, then build WSJT-X.
* WSPR and WSJT do not require Hamlib3.
* Ensure you update Hamlib3 often, as updates are frequently posted.

POTENTIAL ISSUES
* The Mint 17.1 Cinnamon Desktop installs python-numpy as part of it's
  desktop environment. If you encounter PObject errors when running
  WSPR or WSJT, more than likely this is the cause. WSPR and WSJT requires
  python3-numpy. To resolve, remove python-numpy, but be warned, this may
  cause unexpected behavior in your Desktop Environment.


SUPPORT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*SETUP HELP*
The best source of help in setting up your station or configuring WSJT-X is the
WSJT Group at (email address wsjtgroup@yahoogroups.com). The chances are good
that someone with similar interests and equipment has already solved your
problem and will be happy to help.

*BUG REPORTS*
One of your responsibilities as a WSJT-X user is to help the volunteer
programmers to make the program better. Bugs may be reported to WSJT Group 
(email address wsjtgroup@yahoogroups.com) or the WSJT Developers list 
(wsjt-devel@lists.sourceforge.net). To be useful, bug reports should include
at least the following information:

* Program version
* Operating system
* Concise description of the problem
* Sequence of steps required to reproduce the problem

*FEATURE REQUESTS*
Suggestions from users often result in new program features. Good ideas are
always welcome: if thereâ€™s a feature you would like to see in WSJT-X, spell
it out in as much detail as seems useful and send it to us at one the the email
addresses given a few lines above. Be sure to explain why you think the feature
is desirable, and what sort of other users might find it so.
