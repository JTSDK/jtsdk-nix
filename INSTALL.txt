JTSDK v2.0.0-B2 is a collection of Bash scripts designed to assist
users in building (compiling) the various WSJT applicaitons
used by Amateur Radio Operators.

SUPPORTED DISTROS & BUILDS
* Ubuntu .. 14.04 .. WSJT, WSPR, WSJTX
* Mint .... 17.1 ... WSJT, WSPR, WSJTX
* Debian .. 8.0 .... WSJTX Only

** Ubuntu includes Xubuntu, Lubuntu, Kubuntu

BASIC INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS (example is for Ubuntu)
-Download jtsdk-v2.0.0-b2.tar.gz
-Extract: tar -xf jtsdk-v2.0.0-b2.tar.gz

1. Open a Terminal:
2. Type: cd ./jtsdk-v2.0.0-b2
3. Type: ./autogen.sh --with-distro=ubuntu --enable-parallel=yes
4. Type: make
5. Type: sudo make install
6. Type: jtsdk

Note(s):
 a.) During the make process, if your system needs additional packages,
you will be prompted to "re-run" autogeh.sh after running the make command.
This is to ensure all needed packages are picked up by the configure script
after installation.

 b). If building WSJT-X, build Hamlib3 first, then build WSJTX

 c). At present, MAP65 and WSPRX builds have been disabled until
 the source trees have be updated to allow building both Windows and
 Linux.
 
 d). Due to package incompatibilities with Debian Jessie, WSJT
 and WSPR will compile, but may give you runtime errors.
