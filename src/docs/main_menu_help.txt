INTRODUCTION

 JTSDK allows you to build all of the WSJT applicaitons though
 an easy to use menu system. Several build options exist for each
 applicaiton. The outlines the available builds.

 Note: Except for the WSJT-X Super-Build, WSJT-X 1.5.0 and WSJT-X 1.4.0 RC3
 require Hamlib3 to be built before running any of the builds. If it is not
 found in the default location, a message will be displayed prompting you
 to perform the build first.

BUILD DESCRIPTIONS

 WSJT-X 1.5.0 (devel) and WSJT-X 1.4.0 (RC3)
 
 There are (3) primary build types for WSJT-X 1.5.0 and 1.4.0 RC3
 * Release ..: Standard Install Release Build
 * Debug ....: Standard Build With Standard Debugging Enabled
 * Package ..: Builds A Distribution Installer
 
 The distribution ( package ) installer is only available for
 select Linux and Mac distributions. At the time of this writing
 the package target supports:
 
 Debian Based ..: Debian, Ubuntu, Mint etc.
 RPM Based .....: Fedora, OpenSUSE, etc
 

 WSJT (devel) and WSPR (devel)
 
 Both WSJT and WSPR have many targets each. Currenly, the build script
 simply builds the install target. Later version will include the
 individual targets for each applicaiton. 
 
 
 WSPR-X (devel) and MAP65 (devel)

 Currently, WSPR-X and MAP65 cannot be built on Linux without applying several
 patches to accomidate changes from Windows. As such, the builds are
 classed as "under development"  at this time. When the source codes has been
 updated to build on Linux, the builds will be enabled.
