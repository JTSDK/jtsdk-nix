APPLICATION BUILD NOTES
* If building WSJT-X, build Hamlib3 first, then build WSJT-X.
* WSPR and WSJT do not require Hamlib3.
* To update your builds, simply run JTSDK, and select the package.
* Ensure you update Hamlib3 often, as updates are frequently posted.


POTENTIAL ISSUES
* The Mint 17.1 Cinnamon Desktop installs python-numpy as part of it's
  desktop environment. If you encounter PObject errors when running
  WSPR or WSJT, more than likely this is the cause. WSPR and WSJT requires
  python3-numpy. To resolve, remove python-numpy, but be warned, this may
  cause unexpected behavior in your Desktop Environment.

* Type: cd ./jtsdk-nix-2.0.1
* TYpe, sudo make uninstall
