JTSDK-NIX Original

** No longer being maintained.

This version was the original set of scripts brought over
from the WSJT project: branches/jtsdk/nix. Some updates,
though minor, may have been applied, but should be minimal.

This version of was known to work with:

Ubuntu 14.04
Mint-16 / 17

It should be able to build :
WSPR: latest dev branch
WSJT: latest dev branch
WSJTX: latest dev branch install release target

Package dependencies were problematic with WSPR and WSJT, specifically

python3-pil
python3-pil.imagetk
python3-tk
python3-numpy

The main problems were package versions and naming between the various 
Debian based distributions.

This version uses a setup.sh script to install dependencies 
and build Hamlib3. It is being left for historical reference
only.

This build also contains a script in ./scripts that should, 
with little to no modification, build either

WSJT-X v1.5-devel
WSJT-X v.1.4 Release Candidate

Assuming you ahve all the dependencies met for a proper build.See 
comments in the script for usage.
